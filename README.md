# React-Next-Career-Blog

Production ready boilerplate for creating a blog with Next, React, and Styled Component.

In this project, I've used WordPress REST API to pull the posts from [akceed career blog](https://www.akceed.com/career-blog). You can easily choose your own endpoints in ```api/posts/index.js``` to fetch from your API or CMS of choice.

## Usage
To use this repo you need to have ```node``` & ```npm``` installed. Clone this repo & run the following from command line:
```shelll
$ git clone https://github.com/kukiron/react-next-career-blog.git

```
then move to ```localhost:3000```.
