Production ready boilerplate for creating a blog with Next, React, and Styled Component.

In this project, I've used WordPress REST API to pull the posts from a [career blog](https://www.akceed.com/career-blog). You can easily choose your own endpoints in ```api/posts/index.js``` to fetch from your API or CMS of choice.
