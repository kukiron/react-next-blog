Production ready boilerplate for creating a blog with Next, React, and Styled Component.

In this project, I've used WordPress REST API to pull the posts from a [career blog](https://www.akceed.com/career-blog). You can easily choose your own endpoints in `api/posts/index.js` to fetch from your API or CMS of choice.

## Usage

To use this repo you need to have `node` & `npm` installed. Clone this repo & run the following from command line:

```shell
> git clone https://github.com/kukiron/react-next-career-blog.git
> cd react-next-career-blog
> npm install
> npm run dev
```

then move to `localhost:3000`.

Happy blogging! 👍
